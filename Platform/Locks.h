	/// Spin lock.
	///
	/// This provides a simple mechanism for synchronizing access to a given resource through the use of a spin lock.
	/// A lock is acquired simply by setting an integer to a non-zero value.  While the counter is non-zero, any other
	/// thread that tries to acquire a lock will block until the counter is available.  Instead of letting the OS handle
	/// putting the thread into a wait state until the lock is available, the thread continuously repeats its attempt to
	/// acquire the lock.  To avoid excess starving of other threads, the thread will yield after each failed attempt.
	///
	/// Note that recursive locking is not supported.  If a thread attempts to acquire a lock while it already has one,
	/// a deadlock will occur.

	/// desired.  This allows for much more minimal blocking of threads, particularly when exclusive write access is
