    /// All supported platforms provide support for 32-bit integer types and pointer types (either 32-bit or 64-bit).
    /// Note that most operations come in four different variants: standard, with "acquire" access semantics, with
    /// "release" access semantics, and with "unsafe" access semantics.
    /// - Standard variants (those not suffixed with "Acquire", "Release", or "Unsafe") operate with full memory
    ///   barriers before and after the atomic operation is performed.  This guarantees all memory reads and writes
    ///   performed before the atomic update are made visible on all threads before the atomic update is made visible,
    ///   and all memory reads and writes performed after the atomic operation is performed are made visible on all
    ///   threads after the atomic update is made visible.  While this is the safest to use on platforms where memory
    ///   reads and writes can be reordered, it is also the slowest.
    /// - "Acquire" variants (those suffixed with "Acquire") operate with a memory barrier placed after the atomic
    ///   operation is performed.  This guarantees that all memory reads and writes performed after the atomic update
    ///   are made visible on all threads after the atomic update itself is made visible.
    /// - "Release" variants (those suffixed with "Release") operate with a memory barrier placed before the atomic
    ///   operation is performed.  This guarantees that all memory reads and writes performed before the atomic update
    ///   are made visible on all threads before the atomic update itself is made visible.
    /// - "Unsafe" variants (those suffixed with "Unsafe") do not guarantee any memory barrier placement, and as such
    ///   can be reordered.  This yields the best performance, although it forces the user to be aware of any necessary
    ///   placement of memory barriers in their code to avoid any unwanted side-effects.
