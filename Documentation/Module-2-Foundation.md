Foundation is a platform agnostic container and utility library that provides:
* Linear allocation based C++ containers (DynamicArray, Map, Set, Hashtable, etc...)
* Streams (file, memory, byte-swapping)
* Delegates and events (similar to C#'s implementation)
* Interprocess communication
* MessagePack implementation
* Natural sorting
* Numeric limits
* Reference counting
* Endianness conversion
* String and Name classes
* Color coded logging with warnings and errors
* CRC-32 and MD5 generation
* TUID, a 64-bit unique identifier

## Design

Foundation is designed to contain code appropriate for any platform, including handheld and console platforms.  It is a general purpose C++ library.
